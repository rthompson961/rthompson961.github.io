            </p>

            <p>
                The aim of this project was to create something resembling a fully 
                functioning site to get to grips with the practicalities of 
                using Symfony and related tech in a r situation with all 
                of the awkward realities and compromises that real business needs 
                involve.
            </p>

            <p>I expressed this as the following requirements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Database structure where products have attributes split across
                    at least 3 tables necessitating some non-trivial queries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple variations of some products with appropriate navigation to 
                    identify this to users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shop interface that allows filtering by category, brand and colour, 
                    sorting by multiple options and pagination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Product catalogue of at least 50 items with images and 
                    content for each.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Authentication system where users can register, login and content 
                    is restricted to guests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Basic shopping cart which is available to both users and guests and 
                    is not hampered by the auth system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration with a credit card payment provider. This should be as 
                    painless as possible for the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unit tests for all services and functional tests for all controllers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuous Integration which polls source control for new commits,
                    builds them automatically in a staging area and deploys to the cloud 
                    if tests pass.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adherence to code standards with strong typing, PHPStan static analysis
                    on the highest setting, PSR2 style guide and clean HTML.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Responsive layout that automatically adapts to any screen width.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <hr data-content="Database" />
            <img src="clothes_erd.png" alt="database schema" />
            <p>Most of the schema is self explanatory. Here's an example of the product hierarchy:</p>
            <p>
                <b>ProductGroup</b> - V-Neck T-Shirt<br />
                <b>Product</b> - V-Neck T-Shirt in Red<br />
                <b>ProductUnit</b> - V-Neck T-Shirt in Red in Small<br />
                Products in a singular colour will not have a product group.
            </p>
            <hr data-content="Continuous Integration" />
            <img src="pipeline.png" alt="pipeline" />
            <p>Travis CI polls GitHub for new commits, upon finding one:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Starts up containers based upon the docker-compose file (see below)</li>
                <li>Loads composer dependencies</li>
                <li>Dumps environment variables to a production file</li>
                <li>Creates the database, runs migrations and loads fixtures</li>
                <li>Runs unit and functional tests</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If everything passes the site is zipped, uploaded to a S3 bucket where CodeDeploy
                transfers it to a running EC2 instance.
            </p>
