            <p>
                The aim of this project was to create something resembling a fully 
                functioning site to get to grips with the practicalities of 
                using Symfony and related tech in a r situation with all 
                of the awkward realities and compromises that real business needs 
                involve.
            </p>

            <p>I expressed this as the following requirements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Database structure where products have attributes split across
                    at least 3 tables necessitating some non-trivial queries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple variations of some products with appropriate navigation to 
                    identify this to users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shop interface that allows filtering by category, brand and colour, 
                    sorting by multiple options and pagination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Product catalogue of at least 50 items with images and 
                    content for each.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Authentication system where users can register, login and content 
                    is restricted to guests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Basic shopping cart which is available to both users and guests and 
                    is not hampered by the auth system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration with a credit card payment provider. This should be as 
                    painless as possible for the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unit tests for all services and functional tests for all controllers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuous Integration which polls source control for new commits,
                    builds them automatically in a staging area and deploys to the cloud 
                    if tests pass.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adherence to code standards with strong typing, PHPStan static analysis
                    on the highest setting, PSR2 style guide and clean HTML.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Responsive layout that automatically adapts to any screen width.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <hr data-content="Database" />
            <img src="clothes_erd.png" alt="database schema" />
            <p>Most of the schema is self explanatory. Here's an example of the product hierarchy:</p>
            <p>
                <b>ProductGroup</b> - V-Neck T-Shirt<br />
                <b>Product</b> - V-Neck T-Shirt in Red<br />
                <b>ProductUnit</b> - V-Neck T-Shirt in Red in Small<br />
                Products in a singular colour will not have a product group.
            </p>
            <hr data-content="Continuous Integration" />
            <img src="pipeline.png" alt="pipeline" />
            <p>Travis CI polls GitHub for new commits, upon finding one:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Starts up containers based upon the docker-compose file (see below)</li>
                <li>Loads composer dependencies</li>
                <li>Dumps environment variables to a production file</li>
                <li>Creates the database, runs migrations and loads fixtures</li>
                <li>Runs unit and functional tests</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If everything passes the site is zipped, uploaded to a S3 bucket where CodeDeploy
                transfers it to a running EC2 instance.
            </p>

            <h2>Skinny Controllers</h2>

            <p>
                The most complex aspect of the site is the shop controller 
                which returns a product selection that can be filtered 
                by one or more categories, brands and colours. Results can also 
                be sorted by id, name, lowest price, highest price paginated 
                into sets of 6.
            </p>

            <p>
                A constant battle was the increasing size of the controller,
                I tried to follow the <em>"Skinny controllers, fat models"</em>
                philosophy as suggested by 
                <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/4.0/best_practices/controllers.html">Symfony best practices</a>
                and began to move logic into services. Following this approach
                plus removing some overly officious validation as well as realising that 
                my <em>QueryStringValidator</em>
                service was reinventing methods the HttpFoundation Request class already 
                had (oops!) I was able to reduce the Controller size from 150 lines of code to 30.
            </p>

            <h2>Product Filters</h2>

            <p>
                Each potential filter requires a link
                that can be followed to apply the current selection. Filters
                are separated into those currently active which require a link 
                that removes the filter and those not currently set which require
                one that applies it.
            </p>

            <img src="filters.png" alt="comparison of filter links" />

            <p>
                The first issue is how to handle the storage of the 
                current filter selection, sort order and page number before
                tackling adding/removal new filters.
                Initially I created a url string containing the current selection 
                and manipulated it using <em>substr</em> and <em>str_replace</em>. 
                This took few lines of code so could be slotted in anywhere but 
                seemed brittle and was difficult to test, so I replaced this with 
                a more natural array approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using an array requires two additional functions, one to return an 
                array that has the new filter and another that returns the array 
                with the filter removed. Because every request url requires all
                filter details, this means that the function requires the current
                selection of all three filter types not just the one currently 
                being edited. 
                For example if the link is going to add the colour blue to red and
                yellow that are already applied, it is also necessary to provide 
                the brands and categories that are currently applied otherwise 
                the link will erroneously clear those filters.
            </p>

            <p>
                This creates a trade off between passing in an entire array of filters
                and then looping to the sub-array that needs to be added to / removed 
                and splitting the filters array into separate variables and passing 
                them to the mother separately. The First option creates more complex 
                code and an extra layer of iteration however the second results in 
                longer function definitions as filters are now split between three
                variables rather than one.
                I opted for option one as I felt this was the more readable of the 
                two however I suspect there is a better way of going about this. 
            </p>

            <h2>n + 1 problem</h2>

            <p>
                Something that I became aware of due to Symfony's profiler was 
                the eagerness of Doctrine to fetch entire related objects at 
                when a parent object is retrieved even if that data is not
                currently being used. There was an occasion on 
                the checkout page where I inadvertently triggered the n + 1 problem 
                as Doctrine was automatically grabbing properties from a related 
                table on each iteration of a loop.
                To avoid this on more complex queries I made sure to explicitly collect 
                every field I required and no others with one database request at the 
                beginning of a script rather than leaving it up to Doctrine to collect 
                what it needed on an ad hoc basis.
