                When a new comment is first entered onto the site, a new 
                message is created in the database with its state set 
                to 'submitted'. At this point the user receives a 
                confirmation that their comment has been sent for 
                moderation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile the message contents are placed in the message 
                queue. When the message is processed its contents are 
                first sent to the external <em>akismet</em> spam detection 
                service and depending on the results sent back its state 
                is updated to either 'spam' or 'notspam'. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Messages that are flagged as 'spam' go no further. Newly 
                updated 'notspam' messages are sent by email to an admin  
                with the message contents and links to publish or reject 
                the submitted comment.
            </p>

            <p>
                A verified message has its state updated to 'published' and 
                will now appear on the site when comments are retrieved 
                for the film the comment belongs to. The user who submitted 
                the comment is sent an email notifying them of publication.
